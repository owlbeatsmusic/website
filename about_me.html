            <h2>General</h2>
            <p>I was born 2006 in Sweden. yöp</p>
            
            <h2>Programming</h2>
            <p>I started doing simple games in scratch but felt limited after a while. I learnt python and made automations and later games in tkiner(yeah). Ofc I felt limited with tkinter so I "learnt" godot but reized making games was'nt for me. I went back to python to applications but hated python so I learnt Java for the structure but after a year I relized my mistake(learning Java) so i began learning C. </p>
            
            <h2>Piano / Music</h2>
	    <p>I've always created music and my first more "serious" music was my electronic music on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/1mgENzjv3bbuKRadOfNuEq" target="_blank">spotify</a> but later when i started playing the piano, I didn't stop.</p>
