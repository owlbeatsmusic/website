    <h3>about me</h3>
    I was born 2006 in Sweden. yöp
    
    <b>Programming</b>
    I started doing simple games in scratch but felt limited after a while. I learnt python and made automations and later games in tkiner(yeah). Ofc I felt limited with tkinter so I "learnt" godot but reized making games was'nt for me. I went back to python to applications but hated python so I learnt Java for the structure but after a year I relized my mistake(learning Java) so i began learning C.
    
    <b>Piano / Music</b>
    I've always created music and my first more "serious" music was my electronic music on spotify but later when i started playing the piano, I didn't stop.
